# Golang language bindings for NeTEx
This library aims to provides basic NeTEx bindings for golang that are more readable and intuitive to use than autogenerated ones.
It is intended to be used with the golang `encoding/xml` library.

It is currently a partial implementation, based on the Italian profile, developed alongside our
[Transmodel API](https://github.com/noi-techpark/transmodel-api), and covers those use cases:

- bike sharing
- car sharing
- parking
- flights

That being said, we warmly welcome contributions to bring this towards complete NeTEx coverage.

## Usage
`go get github.com/noi-techpark/go-netex`

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
